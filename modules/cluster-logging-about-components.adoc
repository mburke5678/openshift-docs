[id="cluster-logging-about-components_{context}"]
= Cluster logging components 

The cluster logging components include a collector deployed to each node in the {product-title} cluster 
that collects all node and container logs and writes them to a log store. You can use a centralized web UI 
to create rich visualizations and dashboards with the aggregated data.

There are three types of cluster logging components:

* collection - This is the component that collects logs from the node, formats them, and forwards them to the log store. The current implementation is Fluentd.
* log store - This is where the logs are stored. The default implementation is Elasticsearch. You can use the default Elasticsearch log store or forward logs to external log stores. 
* visualization - This is the UI component you can use to view logs, graphs, charts, and so forth. The current implementation is Kibana.
