= Configure CPU and memory limits

The cluster logging components allow for adjustments to both the CPU and memory limits.

<1> Specify the CPU and memory limits and requests for the log storage as needed. For Elasticsearch, you must adjust both the request value and the limit value.
<2> Specify the CPU and memory limits and requests for the log visualization as needed.
<3> Specify the CPU and memory limits and requests for the log curation as needed.
<4> Specify the CPU and memory limits and requests for the log collection as needed.
