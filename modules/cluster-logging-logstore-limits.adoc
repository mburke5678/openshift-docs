The log store allows for adjustments to both the CPU and memory limits. 

.Procedure

. Edit the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) in the `openshift-logging` project: 
+
----
$ oc edit ClusterLogging instance
----

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
metadata:
  name: "instance"

...

spec:
  managementState: "Managed"
  logStore:
    type: "elasticsearch"
    elasticsearch:
      nodeCount: 2
      resources: <1>
        limits:
          memory: 2Gi
        requests:
          cpu: 200m
          memory: 2Gi
...
----
<1> Specify the CPU and memory limits and requests for the log storage as needed. For Elasticsearch, you must adjust both the request value and the limit value.
