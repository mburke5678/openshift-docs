= Understanding custom machine config pools

You can create custom machine config pools that give you the ability to deploy changes that are targeted at specific worker nodes. One example of this is an infrastructure node that hosts only infrastructure components, such as the router or the image registry.   

Custom machine config pools are based on the worker machine config pool. As such, custom pools inherit their initial configuration from the worker pool and any change to the worker pool is applied to the custom pool. Changes to the custom pool are not inherited by the worker pool. For more information on custom machine config pools, see "Using custom machine config pools to configure nodes".

[NOTE]
====
You cannot use a master machine config pool to create a custom pool.
