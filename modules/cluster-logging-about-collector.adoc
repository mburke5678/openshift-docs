= About the logging collector

{product-title} uses Fluentd to collect container and node logs.

The logging collector is deployed as a DaemonSet in {product-title} that deploys pods to each {product-title} node.
`journald` is the system log source supplying log messages from the operating system, the container runtime, and {product-title}.

The container runtimes provide minimal information to identify the source of log messages: project, pod name, 
and container id. This is not sufficient to uniquely identify the source of the logs. If a pod with a given name 
and project is deleted before the log collector begins processing its logs, information from the API server, such as labels and annotations, 
might not be available. There might not be a way to distinguish the log messages from a similarly named pod and project or trace the logs to their source. 
This limitation means log collection and normalization is considered *best effort*.

[IMPORTANT]
====
The available container runtimes provide minimal information to identify the
source of log messages and do not guarantee unique individual log
messages or that these messages can be traced to their source.
