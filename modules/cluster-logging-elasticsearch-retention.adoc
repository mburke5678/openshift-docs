= Configuring log retention time

You can specify how long the default Elasticsearch log store keeps indices 
using a separate _retention policy_ for each of the three log sources: 
infrastructure logs, application logs, and audit logs. The retention policy, 
configured using the `maxAge` parameter in the Cluster Logging Custom Resource 
(CR), determines when to delete the Elasticsearch indices. 

Elasicsearch rolls over an index, moving the current index and creating a new 
index, when an index matches any of the following conditions:

* the index is older than than the `rollover.maxAge`.
* the index size is greater than 40gb*number of primary shards.
* the index doc count is greater than 40960*number of primary shards.

If you do not create a retention policy for any of the log sources, logs 
are retained for seven days by default. If you do not specify a retention policy 
for all three log sources, logs from only the sources with a retention policy 
are stored. For example, if you do not set a retention policy for audit logs, 
the audit logs will not be retained and there will be no *audit-* index in 
Elasticsearch or Kibana. 

.Prerequisites

* Cluster logging and Elasticsearch must be installed.

.Procedure

To configure the log retention time:

. Edit the Cluster Logging CR to add or modify the `retentionPolicy` parameter:
+
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "ClusterLogging"
...
spec:
  managementState: "Managed"
  logStore:
    type: "elasticsearch"
    retentionPolicy: <1>
      application:
        maxAge: 1d
      infra:
        maxAge: 7d
      audit:
        maxAge: 7d
    elasticsearch:
      nodeCount: 3
...
----
<1> Specify the time that Elasticsearch should retain each log source. Enter an 
integer and a time designation: weeks(w), hours(h/H), minutes(m) and seconds(s). 
For example, `1d` for one day. Logs older than the `maxAge` are deleted. 
By default, logs are retained for seven days. 

. You can verify the settings in the Elasticsearch Custom Resource (CR).
+
For example. the Cluster Logging Operator will generate the following
Elasticsearch CR, which has a retention policy to roll over 
active indices for the infrastructure logs every eight hours and the old indices 
are deleted seven days after rollover. {product-title} checks every 15 minutes 
to determine if the infrastructure indices need to be rolled over.
+
----
apiVersion: "logging.openshift.io/v1"
kind: "Elasticsearch"
metadata:
  name: "elasticsearch"
spec:
  indexManagement:
    policies: <1>
      - name: infra-policy
        phases:
          delete:
            minAge: 7d <2>
          hot:
            actions:
              rollover:
                maxAge: 8h <3>
        pollInterval: 15m <4>
...
----
<1> For each log source, the retention policy indicates when to delete and 
rollover logs for that source. The policy includes: 
<2> When the rolled-over indices will be deleted after rollover. This setting 
is the `maxAge` you set in the cluster logging CR.
<3> When to rollover the indices. This value is determined from the `maxAge` 
you set in the cluster logging CR.  
<4> When to check if rollover should be performed. This setting is the default 
and cannot be changed.
+
[NOTE]
====
Modifying the Elasticsearch CR is not supported. All changes to the retention 
policies must be made in the cluster logging CR.
==== 
+
The Elasticsearch Operator deploys a CronJob for each mapping to rollover 
using the defined policy, scheduled using the `pollInterval`.
