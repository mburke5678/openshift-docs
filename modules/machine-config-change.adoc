= What can you change with machine configs?

The kinds of components that MCO can change include:

* **config**: Create Ignition config objects (see the link:https://coreos.github.io/ignition/configuration-v3_2/[Ignition configuration specification]) to do things like modify files, systemd services, and other features on {product-title} machines, including:
- **Configuration files**: Create or overwrite files in the `/var` or `/etc` directory.
- **systemd units**: Create and set the status of a systemd service or add to an existing systemd service by dropping in additional settings.
- **users and groups**: Change SSH keys in the passwd section postinstallation.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
* Changing SSH keys by using a machine config is supported only for the `core` user.
* Adding new users by using a machine config is not supported.
====
* **kernelArguments**: Add arguments to the kernel command line when {product-title} nodes boot.
* **kernelType**: Optionally identify a non-standard kernel to use instead of the standard kernel. Use `realtime` to use the RT kernel (for RAN). This is only supported on select platforms. Use the `64k-pages` parameter to enable the 64k page size kernel. This setting is exclusive to machines with 64-bit ARM architectures.

* **fips**: Enable link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/security_hardening/index#using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies_security-hardening[FIPS] mode. FIPS should be set at installation-time setting and not a postinstallation procedure.

* **extensions**: Extend {op-system} features by adding selected pre-packaged software. For this feature, available extensions include link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/security_hardening/index#protecting-systems-against-intrusive-usb-devices_security-hardening[usbguard] and kernel modules.
* **Custom resources (for `ContainerRuntime` and `Kubelet`)**: Outside of machine configs, MCO manages two special custom resources for modifying CRI-O container runtime settings (`ContainerRuntime` CR) and the Kubelet service (`Kubelet` CR).

The MCO is not the only Operator that can change operating system components on {product-title} nodes. Other Operators can modify operating system-level features as well. One example is the Node Tuning Operator, which allows you to do node-level tuning through Tuned daemon profiles.

By default, many of the changes you make with the MCO require a reboot.

In other cases, you can mitigate the disruption to your workload when the MCO makes changes by using _node disruption policies_. For information, see _Understanding node restart behaviors after machine config changes_.

There might be situations where the configuration on a node does not fully match what the currently-applied machine config specifies. This state is called _configuration drift_. The Machine Config Daemon (MCD) regularly checks the nodes for configuration drift. If the MCD detects configuration drift, the MCO marks the node `degraded` until an administrator corrects the node configuration. A degraded node is online and operational, but, it cannot be updated. For more information on configuration drift, see _Understanding configuration drift detection_.
