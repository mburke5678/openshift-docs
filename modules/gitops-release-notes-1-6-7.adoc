== Fixed issues
The following issue has been resolved in the current release:

* Before this update, all versions of the Argo CD Operator, starting with v0.5.0 were vulnerable to an information disclosure flaw. As a result, unauthorized users could enumerate application names by inspecting API error messages and use the discovered application names as the starting point of another attack. For example, the attacker might use their knowledge of an application name to convince an administrator to grant higher privileges. This update fixes the CVE-2022-41354 error. link:https://issues.redhat.com/browse/GITOPS-2635[GITOPS-2635], link:https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2022-41354[CVE-2022-41354]
