The following enhancements are included in this z-stream release.

* With this update, a new guard has been introduced to the 4.20 Machine-Config Operator to protect clusters that depend on mirrored {product-title} release images during the transition to {product-title} 4.21. This enhancement notifies customers operating in disconnected environments in advance that {product-title} 4.21 requires `Sigstore` signatures to be present. This check ensures users are notified that their image mirrors must be hosted on an OCI-compatible registry. Consequently, this ensures they use the version of `oc-mirror` aligned with the 4.21 release to automatically capture the required signatures within the payload, preventing upgrade failures due to missing cryptographic metadata.
