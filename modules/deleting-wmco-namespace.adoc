= Deleting the Windows Machine Config Operator namespace and operands

After removing the Windows Machine Config Operator, it is recommended that you remove the other components associated with the Operator to avoid potential issues.

.Prerequisites

* The Windows `Machine` objects that hosted your Windows workloads are removed from your cluster.
* The WMCO is removed from your cluster.

.Procedure

This procedure assumes that you are using the default `openshift-windows-machine-config-operator` namespace.

// Removing the workloads and pods steps, as these should have been done as a prereq for removing the Operator
