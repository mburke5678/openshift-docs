= Configuring a worker latency profile on installation

If you anticipate that your cluster network might experience latency issues that could benefit from a worker latency profile, you can configure the policy at the time you install a cluster.

The installation process adds the specified policy to the `node.config` object, which you can edit at any time to change the profile as needed.

.Procedure

. Before executing the `openshift-install create cluster` task, create the `node.config` object:

.. Create a YAML file similar to the following:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Node
metadata:
 name: cluster
spec:
 workerLatencyProfile: "MediumUpdateAverageReaction" <1>
----
<1> Specifies the worker latency policy to deploy upon installation, either `MediumUpdateAverageReaction` `LowUpdateSlowReaction`,

.. Create the object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc create -f <filename>.yaml
----

.Verification 

. Check that the correct worker latency policy was configured by looking in the `nodes.config` object:
+
[source,terminal]
----
$ oc get nodes.config/cluster -o yaml|grep spec -A2
----
+
.Example output
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: Node
 ...
spec:  
  workerLatencyProfile: LowUpdateSlowReaction
 ...
----
