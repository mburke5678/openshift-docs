ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-webscale,openshift-origin[]
As a cluster administrator, you can deploy cluster logging to
aggregate all the logs from your {product-title} cluster, such as node system logs, application container logs,
and so forth.
endif::[]

ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
As an administrator, you can deploy cluster logging to
aggregate logs for a range of {product-title} services.

Cluster logging runs on worker nodes. As an
 administrator, you can monitor resource consumption in the
console and via Prometheus and Grafana. Due to the high work load required for
logging, more worker nodes may be required for your environment.

Logs in {product-title} are retained for seven days before rotation. Logging
storage is capped at 600GiB. This is independent of a cluster's allocated base
storage.
