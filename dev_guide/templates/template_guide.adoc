A template describes a set of objects that can be parameterized and processed to produce a list of objects for creation by OpenShift. 

A template can be processed to create anything you have permission to create within a project, for example
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[services],
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#builds[build configurations], and
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment configurations]. 
A template may also define a set of xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels]
to apply to every object defined in the template.

A template can also define a set of labels to apply to every object defined in the template.

A template typically contains:

* A set of resources that will be created as part of _creating/deploying_ the template
* A set of values for the parameters defined in the template
* A set of labels to describe the generated resources

A template file can be in JSON or YAML format and can be loaded into {product-title} for user instantiation, also known as application creation.

The templates can have global visibility scope (visible for every OpenShift project) or project visibility scope (visible only for a specific project).

== Types of templates

{product-title} supports two general types of templates: predefined templates installed by default and custom templates that you can create. 

[[dev-guide-templates-predef]]
=== Predefined Templates

Typically, the PaaS provider will provide users with a set of predefined templates that will cover all of the usages or typologies/topologies of applications that can be deployed on OpenShift.

The set of predefined templates will be accessible through the CLI or through the Web console.

When creating your application using one of these templates, the user will typically provide the template with the source for the code of the application and some other configuration items such as the application name, database credentials, etc.

[[dev-guide-templates-custom]]
=== Custom templates

Another use case is when you have a typology/topology of an application that does not fit into the provided templates and you want to create a template to model it. This will be the topic for the next article, a walkthrough on how to create a template for your application.

[[dev-guide-templates-benefits]]
== Benefits of using templates
A template provides developers with an easy way to create all the necessary OpenShift resources for their application to work. This allows a developer to quickly deploy an application without having to understand all of the internals of the OpenShift 3 platform.

* As a PaaS provider you have better control on what is being created and can make better usage of your resources.
* As a PaaS provider you can define different Service Level Agreements in templates, defining the amount of host resources (cpu, memory) each and every container can consume.
