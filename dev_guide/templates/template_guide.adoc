A template describes a set of objects that can be parameterized and processed to produce objects for creation in {poduct-title}. 

A template can be used to create anything you have permission to create within a project, for example
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#services[services],
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.adoc#builds[build configurations], and
xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/deployments.adoc#deployments-and-deployment-configurations[deployment configurations]. 
A template may also define a set of xref:../../architecture/core_concepts/pods_and_services.adoc#labels[labels]
to apply to every object defined in the template.

A template can also define a set of labels to apply to every object defined in the template.

A template typically contains:

* A set of resources that will be created as part of _creating/deploying_ the template;
* A set of values for the parameters defined in the template;
* A set of labels to describe the generated resources.

A template file can be in JSON or YAML format and can be loaded into {product-title} for user instantiation, also known as application creation.

The templates can have global visibility scope (visible for every OpenShift project) or project visibility scope (visible only for a specific project).

Many users will only need access to the default xref:dev-guide-templates-predef[predefined] templates for all their needs. Check that the administrator
xref:../../dev_guide.adoc#dev-guide-templates-loading[loaded the templates into your project] 
and xref:../../dev_guide/templates/templates_using.adoc#dev-guide-templates-using[get started using them] to quickly deploy applications. 

For other users, templates can be flexible tools that you can create and customize to meet your needs. Review 
the xref:dev-guide-templates-for-more[sections in this guide] to learn more.   

== Types of templates

{product-title} supports two general types of templates: predefined templates installed by default and custom templates that you can create. 

[[dev-guide-templates-predef]]
=== Predefined Templates

{product-title} provides users with a set of predefined templates that cover all of the applications that users can deploy.

You can access predefined templates through the CLI or through the Web console.

When creating your application using one of these templates, the user will typically provide the template with the source for the code of the application and some other configuration items such as the application name, database credentials, and so forth.

[[dev-guide-templates-custom]]
=== Custom templates

Another use case is when you have a typology/topology of an application that does not fit into the provided templates and you want to create a template to model it. 

[[dev-guide-templates-benefits]]
== Benefits of using templates
A template provides developers an easy way to create all the necessary {product-title} resources for their application to work. Using templates, developers 
can quickly deploy an application without having to understand all of the internals of the {product-title} platform.

* As a PaaS provider you have better control on what is being created and can make better usage of your resources.
* As a PaaS provider you can define different Service Level Agreements in templates, defining the amount of host resources (cpu, memory) each and every container can consume.
