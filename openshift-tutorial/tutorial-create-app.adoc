[[openshift-tutorial-create-app]]
== Creating a New Application

You can use the web console or the CLI to create an application.


[[openshift-tutorial-create-app-git]]
=== Getting the application source 

When using {product-title} in a real-world environment, you will likely have a repository where you store your code, like Git. 

For this tutorial, if you don't have source code, or you want to use the sample code rather than playing with your own, you need to create a _fork_ in the sample repository. A fork is just your own copy of the repo and the code inside (so you don't mess up the source code).

We use a free service called _GitHub_. _Git_ is a free source control system and GitHub is the web service that provides the web hosting for our repository.  

[[openshift-tutorial-create-app-git-get]]
=====Have a GitHub account=====

To use GitHub, you need a free user account. 

If you don't have one, go to link:https://github.com/[https://github.com/] and sign up. We'll wait for you.

If you have an account, move on to xref:openshift-tutorial-create-app-git-fork[Fork the GitHub account].

=====Getting a Git Client=====

You need tools to work with a Git repository. 

If you don't have one, go to get a git client. We'll wait for you.

* This tutorial uses the link:https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git CLI commands] on the system's native console. 
* The Git website has a link:https://git-scm.com/downloads/guis[list of client applications] you can try. 
* GitHub has a link:https://desktop.github.com/[desktop client]. 


[[openshift-tutorial-create-app-git-fork]]
=====Fork the GitHub account=====

Now that you have a GitHub account and client, you are ready to fork. 

If you have your own repo, feel free to use it. For the rest of you:

. Go to our link:https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git[sample Ruby repo] in GitHub.
+
----
https://github.com/openshift/ruby-ex.git
----  

. Click the Clone or Download button in the corner.
+

. You can use SSH or HTTPS to fork a repo in GitHub. This tutorial uses the SSH method.

.Click the clipboard icon to automtically copy the link.
+

. In a console window, enter the SSH string you just copied:
+
----
ssh clone git@github.com:<git-username>/<git-repo>
----
+
It should look something like:

[[openshift-tutorial-create-app-ui]]
=== Using the Web Console

Let's go back to the web console and load your project. If you do not remember how, take a look back at the xref:../openshift-tutorial/tutorial-walkthrough#openshift-tutorial-walk-ui[Walkthrough].

. Click the *Add to Project* button. 

. There, click the language that you are used to working in. For this tutorial, we are using Ruby.
+

. Enter a name for the app and associated resources. Use lowercase letters or numbers and avoid special characters.  If you enter an incorrect character, {product-title} will display the rules.

. Enter your Git repository. If you want to use the sample Git repo for Ruby, click the *Try It* link to load a link to a repo for you.

. Click *Create*.
+

Back on the *Overview* page, you can see your app:

Notice that the application has an IP address automatically assigned. Click the *HTTP* link in the top right corner of the application card.

=== Making changes to your app




[[openshift-tutorial-create-cli]]
== Using the CLI

To create an application using the CLI, we will create a JSON-format file and use the `oc` commaand to build the application.

If you have code of your own, feel free to use it. But, here is a simple, *Hello World* application source:

----
{
  "kind": "Pod",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "hello-openshift",
    "creationTimestamp": null,
    "labels": {
      "name": "hello-openshift"
    }
  },
  "spec": {
    "containers": [
      {
        "name": "hello-openshift",
        "image": "openshift/hello-openshift",
        "ports": [
          {
            "containerPort": 8080,
            "protocol": "TCP"
          }
        ],
        "resources": {},
        "volumeMounts": [
          {
            "name":"tmp",
            "mountPath":"/tmp"
          }
        ],
        "terminationMessagePath": "/dev/termination-log",
        "imagePullPolicy": "IfNotPresent",
        "capabilities": {},
        "securityContext": {
          "capabilities": {},
          "privileged": false
        }
      }
    ],
    "volumes": [
      {
        "name":"tmp",
        "emptyDir": {}
      }
    ],
    "restartPolicy": "Always",
    "dnsPolicy": "ClusterFirst",
    "serviceAccount": ""
  },
  "status": {}
}
----

Open a file on the master using a text editor and copy the source code in. Save the file with a `.json` extension.

Run the following command, using the name of your file:

----
oc create -f hello-openshift.json
pod "hello-openshift" created
----

Now, if you `oc get pod` command, you will start seeing some output:

----
oc get pods
NAME              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-openshift   1/1       Running   0          57s
----
