Docker::
Docker is an open-source technology that creates and deploys containers. That is pretty much all you need to know.

Wait. What's a container, you ask? Don't worry. We'll get to that soon. 

But, if you are curious about Docker, you can start with link:https://www.redhat.com/en/containers/what-is-docker[What is Docker?].

Kubernetes:: 
_If_ you read the {product-title} xref:../architecture/infrastructure_components/kubernetes_infrastructure.adoc#architecture-infrastructure-components-kubernetes-infrastructure[{product-title} documentation], you will learn that Kubernetes _Kubernetes manages containerized applications across a set of containers or hosts and provides mechanisms for deployment, maintenance, and application-scaling. The Docker service packages, instantiates, and runs containerized applications_.

But, all you really need to know is that Kubernetes is what {product-title} uses to manage the Docker containers. Kubernets provides the management, orchestration, scheduling, and operation of containers. You do not need to know how to use the Kubernetes console or CLI, becuase the {product-title} console and CLI interact with Kubernetes for you. 

Again, for the curious, take a look at: link:https://www.redhat.com/en/containers/what-is-kubernetes[What is Kubernetes?].
  
OpenShift: -- provides environment for develop, deploy and run applications
* Console
* CLI
* S2I
* Logging, Metrics
* Container Registry. provides an integrated container registry called OpenShift Container Registry (OCR) that adds the ability to automatically provision new image repositories on demand. This provides users with a built-in location for their application builds to push the resulting images.
