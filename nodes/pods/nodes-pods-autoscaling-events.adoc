= Automatically scaling the number pods based on custom metrics
include::modules/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

As a developer, you can use the custom metrics autoscaler along with the horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) to specify how {product-title} should automatically increase or decrease the number of pods for a replication controller or deployment configuration based on _custom metrics_, which are metrics not based on CPU or memory. For example, you can scale a database based on the number of tables in the database or scale a web application based on the number of incoming HTTP requests. 

You can create an HPA for any `Deployment`, `DeploymentConfig`, `ReplicaSet`, `ReplicationController`, or `StatefulSet` object.

For information on scaling pods based on CPU and memory, see xref:../../nodes/pods/nodes-pods-autoscaling.adoc[Automatically scaling the number pods based on CPU and memory metrics].

The {product-title} HPA uses link:https://keda.sh/[KEDA] to drive scaling on custom metrics. KEDA is a Kubernetes-based event driven autoscaler that monitors event sources such as Kafka, RabbitMQ, or cloud event sources and feeds the metrics from those sources into the HPA.

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to use a `Deployment` object or `ReplicaSet` object unless you need a specific feature or behavior provided by other objects. For more information on
these objects, see xref:../../applications/deployments/what-deployments-are.adoc#what-deployments-are[Understanding Deployment and DeploymentConfig objects].
