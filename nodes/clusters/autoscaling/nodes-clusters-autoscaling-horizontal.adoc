= Automatically scaling pods with the horizontal pod autoscaler
include::_attributes/common-attributes.adoc[]

toc::[]

As a developer, you can use a horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) to
specify how {product-title} should automatically increase or decrease the scale of
a replication controller or deployment configuration, based on metrics collected
from the pods that belong to that replication controller or deployment
configuration. You can create an HPA for any `Deployment`, `DeploymentConfig`,
`ReplicaSet`, `ReplicationController`, or `StatefulSet` object.

[NOTE]
====
It is recommended to use a `Deployment` object or `ReplicaSet` object unless you need a specific feature or behavior provided by other objects. For more information on
these objects, see xref:../../../applications/deployments/what-deployments-are.adoc#what-deployments-are[Understanding Deployment and DeploymentConfig objects].
====

The horizontal pod autoscaler (HPA) extends the concept of pod auto-scaling. The HPA lets you create and manage a group of load-balanced nodes. The HPA automatically increases or decreases the number of pods when a given CPU or memory threshold is crossed.

The HPA is an API resource in the Kubernetes autoscaling API group. 

[NOTE]
====
To implement the HPA, all targeted pods must have a resource request set on their containers.
